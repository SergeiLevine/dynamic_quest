# A simple screen with generic forms

### 'npm run dev'

Runs both the app and json-server

Based on the structure of data/db.json the forms will display/hide and prevent submission if requirements not met.

I created this simple app with minimal imports as i could and i know that with Redux
it would take me much less time and code.(I wanted to challenge myself)
